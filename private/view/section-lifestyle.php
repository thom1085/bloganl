              <div class="item-title">New year resolutions for 2018</div>
              <p>I have never been one to set goals for the year to come but for some reason this year felt different. Having a full time job, long-term relationship and a toddler can get you stuck in routine and forget about yourself. In 2017 I felt lost. I felt like I was always running around like a headless chicken trying to please everybody but me.
                2018 is the start of this blog, my little space to let it out and share what I like, eat, dress with, film… </p>
                <p>It is a hobby that doesn’t require much equipment, a member card or a particular outfit, just what I can about handle as a working mum.</p>

                <p>With this new year I also want to be even more conscious of what we eat as a family, be stricter on a seasonal products and avoid nasty ingredients in our food as much as possible. Try to cut sugar as much as possible (still a child, I can’t have coffee or tea without) and cakes and biscuits. And bake more!</p>

                <p>We also bought our first flat two years ago and it is far from finished. Although we need to do big jobs like re doing the bathroom or changing all our windows (gonna take a lot of savings) we need to move on the little things that make a « house » a home in our case a flat.</p>
                <p>We would like artwork on the walls, to change our tv stand, dinning table, rugs…and the list goes on. I know I have to be patient but every little improvement in this flat fills me with great joy!</p>

                <p>And to finish it off, travelling! As Thom’s family is based in the UK we tend to go back there a few times a year especially since we had our son. Although it always feels like a second home, I think we would like to explore a bit more of the world or even just Europe. Our little boy is now three and a half and it would be more manageable/enjoyable to travel with him nowadays.</p>
                <p>There you have it, let’s hope I stick to as many things as possible and HAPPY 2018!</p>
